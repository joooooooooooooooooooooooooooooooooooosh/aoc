# Rust
The rust solutions to parts 1 and 2 are in the `src/` directory in the corresponding `dayxx.rs` file, where `xx` is the day number.

These can be run with `cargo run xx` or just `cargo run` to run the latest problem.

# Shell
Inside the `cursed-sh/` directory are my 1 line shell solutions to part 1 of each day in the corresponding `xx.sh` file.

These are designed to be run from the root project directory as `cursed-sh/xx.sh`.
